# `gamut`

## **G**eospatial **A**nalytics for **M**ultisector **U**rban **T**eleconnections

## Description
`gamut` is a tool for exploring *teleconnections* between cities of the United States and human activities that occur in their associated water supply catchments. A *teleconnection* is a causal connection or correlation between human and environmental phenomena that occur a long distance apart.

## Get Started with `gamut`

`gamut` can be installed remotely from the repository using the R `devtools` package. From an R prompt, run the command:
```r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('IMMM-SFA/gamut')
library(gamut)
```

If you run into problems with the remote installation, you may also try these other options to install gamut:

1. Save the package file by clicking [here](https://api.github.com/repos/IMMM-SFA/gamut/tarball/HEAD), then run `install_local()` as shown below:
```r
install_local('path/to/package')
```

2. Clone [the repo][repository] to your computer using `git clone "https://github.com/IMMM-SFA/gamut"`. You can then load this project into your RStudio and install it.

NOTE: Depending on your version of R, you may need to install Rtools to retrieve the package. If you have trouble installing it with `install.packages("Rtools")`, you can find the install file [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). Depending on your version of `sf`, also may need to install the package `Rcpp` in order for `gamut` to build correctly. 

## Data Files

To download all of the `gamut` input datasets, visit the [Zenodo data repository](https://zenodo.org/record/5554939#.YV9dnNrMJPY) and download the zipped data files to your preferred directory. Make sure to combine the energy, land, misc, and water folders into a single directory. The table below shows all the files used within the `gamut` software package.

## Usage

Once all the necessary data is organized in the correct format, the package is ready to be used. The main function is `count_watershed_teleconnections`. Within this function, set up your data directory and select cities. The city names need to be in the format of `City | State`, and for multiple cities, place them inside `c()`. __Available cities can be found on the [Available Cities wiki page](https://github.com/IMMM-SFA/gamut/wiki/Available-Cities).__

Here is an example of what you would type into your console: 

```r
count_watershed_teleconnections(data_dir = "your/gamut/data_dir", cities = c("Portland | OR", "Knoxville | TN", "New York | NY", "Indianapolis | IN", "Seattle | WA"))
```

The package will cycle through each city and their respective watersheds, and produce a table with several columns of information. To learn what each of these variables mean, scroll to the bottom of this section and see the table of variables. The result of this function will look something like this:

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(vroom)
vroom("inst/extdata/example_dataset.csv") -> results
knitr::kable(results)
```

This table can be used to compare different variables between multiple cities. Below is a graph comparing how much developed land are in cities' watersheds. 

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
results %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(city, developed_fraction), y = developed_fraction)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Fraction of Developed Land") +
  theme_classic() 
```


The table below shows explanations for each of these variables that are created through this function:
